Flickr Group Photo Dumper
===

This is a python script that scans through photos of a list of groups, and save the information of photos that aren't under "All Rights Reserved". The purpose is that, in some use cases, we may need to apply others' photos; however, we may only the photos that is under a open license can be used. So, this tool automates the filtering process where Flickr doesn't provide directly.

## Run
